# D4G-tools

## Build the whole stack via Docker

Clone the repository then run `docker build -t d4g .` in the root directory.

After the first build (wich may be slow) you can do
`docker run -p 80:8080 d4g` and then you will have the front at `http://localhost/`

## Build only some parts

Will be written later, maybe during D4G :P
